Part3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKlO8vLvUao The google login mentioned in video was not working for me due to some restrictions from google API and hence, It is implemented in this project some other way.

Please note that since video is 3 years old, many elements or usage of controls have changed. This code implements all of the features with latest version of react.

To run the app, follow the below steps:
* Clone the repository
* Run npm i under both client and server folder
* .env file
  * Replace .env.example with filename .env in server folder
  * Replace 'PORT' with port where you would like to 
  * Replace 'CONNECTION_URL' with your mongodb connection. To find the sam follow below steps:
    * Create an account at https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and create a free cluster
    * You would get a URL like mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.jgauidh.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
    * Copy the same and paste it in .env file
* Run npm start in server folder
* Run npm start in client folder
